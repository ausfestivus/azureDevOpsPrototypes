# azureDevOpsPrototypes

I have spent a lot of time understanding and testing various `azure-pipeline.yaml` constructs. I prototype the Pipeline 
YAML here and save it for future reference.

This repo is my repo for trying things out.

## repo details

* [azure-pipeline.yaml](./azure-pipeline.yaml) - The current prototype WIP
* [azure-pipeline.md](./azure-pipeline.md) - the README for the prototype WIP
* [samples](./samples) - completed prototypes
  * [Sharing variables between job](./samples/sharing-variables-between-jobs.md)
  * [Sharing multiple variables into a template](./samples/multiple-vars-into-a-template.md)

## usage

Develop a prototype solution in the `azure-pipeline.yaml`.
